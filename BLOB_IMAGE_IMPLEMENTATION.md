# BLOB Image Storage Implementation

## What Changed

✅ **Images now stored in database** instead of filesystem  
✅ **No more uploads folder dependency** - images survive deployments  
✅ **Automatic database backups** include all images  

## Database Changes

Added `image_data LONGBLOB NULL` columns to:
- `categories` table
- `inventory` table

## API Changes

### Image Storage
- **Inventory items**: Images stored as BLOB when adding/updating
- **Categories**: Images stored as BLOB when adding/updating
- **Temp files**: Automatically cleaned up after storing in database

### Image Serving
- **Inventory images**: `GET /api/images/:itemId`
- **Category images**: `GET /api/category-images/:categoryId`
- **Caching**: 1-year cache headers for performance

## Migration

Run the migration script to convert existing images:
```bash
cd server
node migrate-images-to-blob.js
```

This will:
- Add BLOB columns to database
- Read existing images from uploads folder
- Store them as BLOB data in database
- Keep original files (you can delete them later)

## Benefits

- ✅ Images never lost on deployments
- ✅ No file management needed
- ✅ Database backups include images
- ✅ Simpler deployment process
- ✅ Better performance with caching

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration script
2. Test adding new items with images
3. Verify images display correctly
4. Delete uploads folder once confirmed working

Your images will now be stored directly in the database and survive all deployments!
