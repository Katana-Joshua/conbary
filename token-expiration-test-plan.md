- ✅ Custom event system for token expiration notifications
- ✅ Proper cleanup of all authentication data

### 2. Automatic Token Refresh
- ✅ Periodic token validation (every 5 minutes)
- ✅ Token refresh on page visibility change
- ✅ Automatic refresh when token becomes invalid
- ✅ User notifications for successful refreshes

### 3. Manual Token Refresh
- ✅ Refresh session button in admin dashboard
- ✅ Refresh session button in cashier dashboard
- ✅ Loading states during refresh
- ✅ Error handling for failed refreshes

### 4. User Experience
- ✅ Toast notifications for session events
- ✅ Automatic redirect to login on expiration
- ✅ Graceful handling of expired sessions
- ✅ No data loss during token refresh

## Test Cases:

### Test 1: Automatic Token Expiration Detection
1. Login as any user
2. Manually expire the token (or wait for natural expiration)
3. Perform any API action (e.g., refresh page, make a request)
4. Verify user is automatically logged out
5. Verify appropriate error message is shown
6. Verify user is redirected to login page

### Test 2: Automatic Token Refresh
1. Login as any user
2. Wait for periodic token validation (5 minutes)
3. Verify token is automatically refreshed if needed
4. Verify user receives notification about refresh
5. Verify no interruption to user workflow

### Test 3: Manual Token Refresh
1. Login as admin user
2. Click "Refresh Session" button in sidebar
3. Verify loading state is shown
4. Verify session is refreshed successfully
5. Verify success notification is shown

### Test 4: Manual Token Refresh (Cashier)
1. Login as cashier user
2. Click "Refresh" button in header
3. Verify loading state is shown
4. Verify session is refreshed successfully
5. Verify success notification is shown

### Test 5: Page Visibility Token Refresh
1. Login as any user
2. Switch to another tab/window
3. Return to the application tab
4. Verify token is validated/refreshed
5. Verify no interruption to user workflow

### Test 6: Failed Token Refresh
1. Login as any user
2. Simulate server error during refresh
3. Verify user is logged out automatically
4. Verify appropriate error message is shown
5. Verify user is redirected to login page

### Test 7: Shift Persistence During Refresh
1. Login as cashier and start a shift
2. Manually refresh session
3. Verify shift remains active
4. Verify all shift data is preserved
5. Verify no interruption to shift operations

### Test 8: Multiple Concurrent Requests
1. Login as any user
2. Make multiple API requests simultaneously
3. Simulate token expiration during requests
4. Verify all requests handle expiration gracefully
5. Verify user is logged out only once

### Test 9: Network Interruption
1. Login as any user
2. Disconnect network connection
3. Perform API action
4. Reconnect network
5. Verify token refresh works correctly

### Test 10: Browser Refresh/Reload
1. Login as any user
2. Refresh the browser page
3. Verify authentication state is preserved
4. Verify token is validated on page load
5. Verify automatic refresh if needed

## Server-Side Implementation:

### Token Refresh Endpoint
- ✅ `/auth/refresh` endpoint for token refresh
- ✅ Requires valid authentication token
- ✅ Returns new token with same user data
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Authentication Middleware
- ✅ Detects expired tokens
- ✅ Returns appropriate error responses
- ✅ Validates user existence in database
- ✅ Proper JWT verification

## Frontend Implementation:

### API Request Handler
- ✅ Detects 401/403 responses
- ✅ Handles token expiration automatically
- ✅ Dispatches custom events for token expiration
- ✅ Cleans up authentication data

### AuthContext
- ✅ Listens for token expiration events
- ✅ Provides manual refresh functionality
- ✅ Periodic token validation
- ✅ Page visibility change handling

### UI Components
- ✅ Refresh buttons in both dashboards
- ✅ Loading states during refresh
- ✅ Toast notifications for all events
- ✅ Proper error handling and display

## Security Considerations:

### Token Security
- ✅ JWT tokens with proper expiration
- ✅ Secure token storage in localStorage
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on expiration
- ✅ No token exposure in logs

### Session Management
- ✅ Proper session termination on logout
- ✅ Cleanup of all stored data
- ✅ No session persistence after logout
- ✅ Secure token refresh mechanism

## Performance Considerations:

### Token Validation
- ✅ Efficient periodic validation (5-minute intervals)
- ✅ Smart validation on page visibility change
- ✅ No excessive API calls
- ✅ Proper cleanup of intervals

### User Experience
- ✅ Non-blocking token refresh
- ✅ Smooth user experience during refresh
- ✅ Clear feedback for all operations
- ✅ Graceful error handling
